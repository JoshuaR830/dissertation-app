# Five Ways to Wellbeing App
An app that motivates users to focus on their mental wellbeing. 

The five ways to wellbeing are a series of things that you can do that aim to help you maintain a positive mental wellbeing. Much like one of your five fruit and veg work for your physical health, the five ways to wellbeing aim to improve your mental health.

This app aims to raise awareness of the five ways to wellbeing. Users can enter the activities they complete each day, different activities will contribute to the five ways to wellbeing in different ways. Then the app will help users to understand which of their ways to wellbeing they are getting enough of and which could be improved.
